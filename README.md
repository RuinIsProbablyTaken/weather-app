# Weather app
This app was one of FCC challenges and was intended for learning purposes only. More specifically it was made in order for me to learn how to dig up documentation on APIs that aren't obvious and well-explained. It drove me to put more effort into finding information and code examples.

It's functional and fairly okay for it's purpose. I should have added more comments in order to explain what's going on and added a self calling function or moved the functions outside of the ready scope and called a central function there instead of instantly firing an AJAX call and calling getWeather from inside of the previous call's success function.
